# 👋 Hi, I'm Trojan (Treauidian)

## 🔧🥊  DevOps Nak Muay | 🐧 Linux Enthusiast | 🧠 Neurodiversity Ally

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a DevOps engineer passionate about automation, clean pipelines, and open source. Whether it's tuning infrastructure or tuning my roundhouse kicks, I'm always striving for efficiency and discipline.

### 🧠 About Me
I'm a proud parent of a neurodiverse child, which constantly shapes how I think about inclusion, patience, and problem-solving—at home and in tech.  
When I’m not in front of a terminal, you’ll probably find me training Muay Thai or trying to perfect the balance between parenthood and professional growth.
